This repository hosts a Statistical Research Project that investigates the potential relationship between education and the risk of developing Alzheimerâ€™s disease in older adults. The project was completed during the winter of 2022/2023 for the Mathematical Statistics course in the second year of the BSc program, in collaboration with colleague Giulia Pezzani.

The repository contains the final PDF report that presents the main techniques used and the results obtained. Additionally, the dataset and the R code used to derive the conclusions are included as separate files.

Please feel free to explore the repository and review the project materials. We hope that this project can contribute to the ongoing research on Alzheimer's disease and its potential risk factors.
